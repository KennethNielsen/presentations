Main exercise

 * Fork it to your own profile (notice it says where it was forked from)
 * Clone this repository to your computer (use the link on the GitLab page)
 * Look around (status, log)
 * Look at remote and add upstream
 * Look at branches (also -a)
 * Create new branch: git branch   or   git checkout -b
 * Create commits (add and commit, status and diff along the way)
 * Push with arguments
 * Look around on GitLab (commits, branches)
 * Make merge request
 * Look at merge request (Discussion, commits, changes)
 ### COFFEE BREAK ###

Setting up passwordless ssh access
----------------------------------
Click the link on GitLab:
Generate key:
 * ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "k.nielsen81@gmail.com"
 * /home/kenni/.ssh/id_rsa_gitlab 
 * cat /home/kenni/.ssh/id_rsa_gitlab 
 * Paste on GitLab page
 * Create a branch and push (without password)

Make feature branch (really)
----------------------------
 * Talk from slides
 * Try ASE workflow








Smaller topics and questions:
=============================

Tracking branch
---------------
Try push with no arguments, set to simple
Set upstream, now push with no arguments work
Checkout branch -vv

commit -a
---------
For single commit changes to known files
